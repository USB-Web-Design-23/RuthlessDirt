			I went to a fair with Jerry where we rode a big red roller coaster. Jerry went to the front of the coaster but I decided to stay at the back. We got all the way up to the top and then we started free falling which is when the person in front of me barfed onto the people at the very front of the coaster. I was fine and Jerry was not. Then we went to the big slide where Jerry went way too fast and crashed into the wall which was the end of poor Jerry and the dream was over.
