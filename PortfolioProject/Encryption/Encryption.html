		Throughout history, war has always caused meesages to need to be encrypted. Early accounts of these include the Roman Empire during Julius Caesar's reign. There is even a cipher named after him: "Caeser Cipher". It works by having every character changed by x. For example if I want to encrypt "Hello" and shift it by 4, I would get "Lipps".

		The Vigenere Cipher uses a key that is a word or string of characters that can represent how much each character in the text shifts.
		For example, if I wanted to encript "hello" while using the key word of "bye", my encrypted message would be "icpmm"

		The Secure Hashing Algorithm (SHA-256) is the safest way to encrypt something in the world at the moment as no computers are currently able to crack it. There are two types that it uses:

		Symmetric Key Encryption
			<li>
				The same key is used for encrypting and decrypting
			</li>
			<li>
				Key has to be known between devices communicating

		Public Key Encryption
			<li>
				A public key for encrypting data but a private key for decrypting it
			</li>
			<li>
				Is fully reliant on authentication (hash-code verification)
