<p>Nadal is an agnostic atheist. Nadal speaks Spanish, Balearic Catalan and English.</p>

<p>In addition to tennis and football, Nadal enjoys playing golf and poker. In April 2014, he played the world's No. 1 female poker player, Vanessa Selbst, in a poker game in Monaco. In October 2020, Nadal competed in the professional-level Balearic Golf Championship, obtaining a World Amateur Golf Ranking in the process.</p>

<p>As a young boy, he would run home from school to watch Goku in his favorite Japanese anime, Dragon Ball. CNN released an article about Nadal's childhood inspiration, and called him "the Dragon Ball of tennis" owing to his unorthodox style "from another planet".
Despite playing tennis left-handed, Nadal is known for being right-handed while doing things in everyday life such as writing and playing golf.</p></div>
