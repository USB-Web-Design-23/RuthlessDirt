			Serena Williams grew up in Compton, California and then moved to Florida for her to be able to practice tennis. Her older sister, Venus, was also an extremely accomplished player and many people predicted she would have more success than Serena. Serena has won 23 Grand Slam singles titles as well as 14 Grand Slam doubles titles with her sister. She recently retired after last year's US Open.
