				This was my first project where I linked css to an html file and then used that to change the styles of the webpage.

				<div class="w">
				This was my first project where I made animations that were a part of my webpage. I was able to do this using keyframes in css which let change the color of text as well as create a slideshow. This was also the first time used a dropdown bar to help navigate multiple webpages.
			</td>

				<div class="w">
				This was the first project where I used JavaScript. Using it, I was able to create a quiz that is able to use your answers to give you a result. It was the first time that I used a form and lots of inputs to create the quiz while giving each question a designated point value. This was by far the most comprehensive and detailed project that I have created in Web Design.
