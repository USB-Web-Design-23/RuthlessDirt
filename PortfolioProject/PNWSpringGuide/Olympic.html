		The Olympic National Park, on the Olympic Peninsula west of Seattle, feautures many beautiful landscapes. Covering nearly a million acres, visit places like the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/olym/planyourvisit/visiting-the-hoh.htm">Hoh Rainforest</a>, or beautiful <a href="https://www.nps.gov/olym/planyourvisit/visiting-lake-crescent.htm">Lake Crescent</a>. You can hike, bike, camp, stay at Lake Crescent, swim, and much much more. Personally, I find the Hoh Rainforest absolutely breathtaking and the views on Lake Crescent spectacular.
