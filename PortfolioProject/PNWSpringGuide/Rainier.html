	<p>
		Mount Rainier National Park is located a little bit east of Seattle. Mount Rainier is an active volcano but hasn't erupted in about 150 years. Mount Rainier is the tallest mountain in the lower 48 and is part of the Cascade Mountain Range. Go <a href="https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/day-hiking-at-mount-rainier.htm">hiking</a> in the beautiful rolling hills or <a href=" https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/climbing.htm">climb</a> parts or all of the Mountain.	If looking to ski, there are lots of good options like Crystal Mountain or White Pass. However, if looking for a very pretty hike, visit Paradise where the views are stunning and the wildlife is out in full force.
