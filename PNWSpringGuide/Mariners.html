		The Seattle Mariners

		The Seattle Mariners are a Professional Baseball Team. They made the playoffs last year and look to do the same or better this year. Going to a game can give you a sense of the Northwest feel, with lots of food options like Fish and Chips or Grasshoppers. You get to watch Julio and Big Dumper hit dingers on a young and exciting team. Click <a href="https://www.mlb.com/mariners/tickets">here</a> to find a game that you can go to.
